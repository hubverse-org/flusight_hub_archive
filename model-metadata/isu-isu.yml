    We use a Bayesian hierarchical model framework to estimate epidemic severity
    which incorporates data from both ILINet and healthtweets.org. The data from
    healthtweets.org is mined from Twitter posts, and is provided 1 week earlier
    than ILINet data, allowing our predictions to benefit from the more recent
    data. The hierarchical structure of our model allows ILINet and healthtweets
    data from previous years to inform the parameter values used for epidemic 
    severity prediction in the current year. Our model fits the shape a normal 
    pdf to the outbreak curve, and we use this shape to predict the outbreak 
    weeks into the future. Currently, healthtweets.org does not offer data at 
    the regional scale, so our regional predictions are informed only by ILINet 
    data.

    Danteplus models the joint distribution of ILI (%) data at the state 
    scale as an overall anchor effect, a state-specific effect, a season-specific, 
    and a seaso/state-specific interaction effect. The  four different effects are 
    modeled as random or reverse-random walks. The seasonal component, instead of a 
    reverse-random walk, uses a non-stationary Gaussian process. The hope is that this 
    GP component adds more uncertainty to the forecasts in the middle of the season, as 
    last year Dante was too confident during winter. State-level forecasts amount to 
    draws from the posterior predictive distribution. Regional and National forecasts 
    are generated as weighted, linear combinations of state forecasts, where the weights 
    are porportional to US Census data to generate wILI forecasts at coarser scales. 
    The An external nowcasting model is used to produce a nowcast (what is sometimes 
    called a 'hindcast') based on Google Health Trends data. The nowcasting model is 
    a LASSO regression model. Nowcasts are generated independently at each geographic 
    scale and are then combined with generalized least squares to be coherent. 
    The nowcasts/hindcasts are appended to the available ILINet data. 
    Note: LANL-Danteplus is the exact same model as for the state challenge.

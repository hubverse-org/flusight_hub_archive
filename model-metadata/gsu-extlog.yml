methods_long: "1. Compute a weighted historical average curve - Each year weighted by error (1/MSE) compared to 4-week best-fit forecast (2007-2018, excl. 2009); 2. Compute average curve of all the 'superforecaster' predictions (8 weeks ahead); 3. Compute weighted curve using current data, best-fit forecast, historical average, and superforecaster average; 4. Fit extended logistic model to weighted curve and use parametric bootstrapping to quantify uncertainty."

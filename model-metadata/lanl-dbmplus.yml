methods_long: "DBMplus combines a mechanistic SIR model with a flexible statistical discrepancy model in a common Bayesian modeling framework. DBMplus fits each region indepencently and thus does not share information across geography. DBMplus independently runs a nowcasting regression (LASSO) model using GHT data as covariates to produce nowcasts. Those nowcasts are appended to the end of the ILINet wILI data."

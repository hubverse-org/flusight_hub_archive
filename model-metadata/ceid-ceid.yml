methods_long: "A statistical model where the seasonal curve is modeled using splines and periodic basis functions. The model is hierarchical, such that each region and year has region- and year-specific spline coefficients that are drawn from hierarchical distribution structures (i.e., year coefficients from “global” coefficients, region coefficients from year coefficients)."

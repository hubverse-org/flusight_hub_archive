methods_long: "We use ILInet data provided by the FluView website, and ILINearby data. We also use absolute humidity data from the National Land Data Assimilation System project-2 dataset. WE use a humidity based SIRS model developed by the Shaman group. We calculated a humidity profile for every city considered in this sutdy. In order to obtain humidity profiles on a HHS region level, we average the humidity profiles of all cities that belong to an HHS region. We use our Multiple Shooting for Stochastic Systems framework."

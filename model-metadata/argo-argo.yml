methods_long: "Our method combines information from electronic health records (EHR) and Internet usersâ€™ search activity (Google) with historical flu activity to produce flu forecasts for the United States. Our methodology is based on a regularized multivariate regression model that dynamically selects the most appropriate variables for optimal flu estimates and automatically identifies which variables are important for prediction in every week."

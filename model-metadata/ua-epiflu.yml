methods_long: "This is the same model as JL2 from last year. It matches the data plotted in the (cumulative wILI, wILI) plane to a curve obtained by averaging rescaled historical information. Noise is added to cumulative wILI reports to generate 15,000 datasets, each of which is run through the model to produce a set of predictions for each target. The latter are used to create the histograms provided in the submission file."

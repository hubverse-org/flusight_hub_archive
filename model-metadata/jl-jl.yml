methods_long: "Data:
- All data (national and regional) were downloaded from ILINet.
- National data (dates and weighted percentages) from 2002 on were used to estimate the amount of uncertainty (noise) in the reported percentages. This was done by smoothing and interpolating the cumulative weighted percentages and measuring the distance between smoothed and reported values.
- Predictions were made based on weighted percentages reported starting on week 39 of 2015.
Model:
- The model is the same as for the CHIKV challenge: a logistic differential equation.
- Parameters are chosen to satisfy the following constraints: (i) the difference between the total number of cases predicted by the model and those reported up to the current time point is close to 0, and (ii) the distance between predicted and reported cumulative epidemiology curves is minimal. This parameter optimization procedure is automated.
- Optimal parameters were estimated for each flu season, from 2002 to 2014, using national level data. For each (national or regional) data set associated with the current flu season, optimal parameters are found using the above historical parameters as seed values.
- Seasonal targets and predictions for the next 4 weeks are then calculated from the model with the chosen parameters.
- The procedure is then repeated N times, with noise added to the initial data set for each trial. Based on the analysis of previous flu seasons at the national level, the absolute value of the noise is drawn from an exponential distribution. Currently, N=100 but larger values may be tried later.
- Probabilities for the seasonal targets and weighted percentages are estimated from the above 13*(N+1) trials."
